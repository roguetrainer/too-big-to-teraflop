🎮 We built a game that lets you experience a financial bubble in real-time 🫧💸 📉

"TOO BIG TO TERAFLOP" is an interactive simulation based on economist HYMAN MINSKY's FINANCIAL INSTABILITY HYPOTHESIS - the theory that STABILITY BREEDS INSTABILITY.

Here's the premise: You're trading AI infrastructure stocks in 2025-2026. You're up against two AI-driven trading algorithms - VALUE TRADERS (who anchor to P/E ratios) and MOMENTUM TRADERS (who chase trends). As the market cycles through DISPLACEMENT → BOOM → EUPHORIA → DISTRESS → PANIC, you have to decide when to buy, hold, or sell.

The twist? The stocks are randomly classified as GROWTH, MEDIOCRE, OR FRAUD - but you won't know which until it's too late.

Why do we set this in the AI boom? Because the current market is showing textbook bubble characteristics:

• Circular revenue (vendor financing loops)
• Infrastructure overbuild (like 1990s "dark fiber")
• "AI-washing" (similar to adding .com in 1999)
• FOMO-driven concentration in foundational model builders

The game uses mathematical models to simulate how these forces interact. Value traders provide stability. Momentum traders create feedback loops. When P/E ratios hit 40+, the sentiment multiplier kicks in and FOMO takes over.

Then someone misses earnings, and the panic begins.

Is AI transformative? Absolutely. Railways revolutionized transport. The Internet revolutionized information. AI will revolutionize intelligence.

But transformative technologies often create the BIGGEST bubbles precisely because they're real. When the technology works, it's easy to convince yourself that "THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT" and traditional valuations no longer apply. 🤪

The game is free (& so far bad!) & runs in your browser. No installation needed - just download the HTML file and play.

Whether you think we're in a bubble or not, it's worth understanding how they form. Minsky's insight was that financial crises aren't accidents - they're the inevitable result of stability itself.

(Also, yes, the title riffs on the critical notion of "Too Big to Fail" - usually applied to financial institutions capable of bringing down the system, &, of course, FLOPS are floating point operations per second. 🤓. Tera sounds like... 😱)
